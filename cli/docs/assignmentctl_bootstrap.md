## assignmentctl bootstrap

Bootstraps the repository with a configuration file ready to go

### Synopsis


Running bootstrap will create a local configuration file for the current
working directory containing minimal information about the course,
passed in either as flags or during interactive prompts.

The configuration file can be customized further afterwards, e.g., by
adding different build recipes and bundling options. For this, see
documentation.


```
assignmentctl bootstrap [flags]
```

      --course string      Course name
      --full               Include all defaults in configuration file
      --git                Create a git repository in the current directory and commit the configuration file immediately
      --group string       Group name

```
